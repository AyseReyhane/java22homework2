	//  Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other 
	//three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
    //  Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) 
	//and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, 
	//the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed 
	//only through the methods of their current class. 
	//Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
    //  To achieve encapsulation in Java −
    //Declare the variables of a class as private.
    //Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
